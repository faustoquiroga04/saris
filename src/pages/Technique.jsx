                    <h2>Dr. Kawakami’s Technique </h2>
                    <p><strong>The PHT Technique®</strong> is an innovation in hair medicine, designed to provide high-density transplants through a painless process, with exclusive monitoring and direct contact with Dr. Filipe Kawakami.</p>

                    <p>Unlike traditional methods, which can be invasive and leave visible scars, the PHT Technique® guarantees a <strong>faster recovery</strong> and aesthetically stunning results, with a more natural appearance and no signs of intervention.</p>

                    <p>The PHT Technique® distinguishes itself in its ability to offer a high density of transplanted hairs, resulting in a fuller, more voluminous appearance. The technique allows for the redistribution of hair strands evenly, respecting the natural aesthetics of each patient's scalp.</p>

                    <h2>The PHT Technique® Process in Two Steps: </h2>

                    <h4>Step 1: Extraction</h4>
                    <p>Hair follicles are extracted one by one from the donor area (typically the back or sides of the head) using a specialized, powered device.</p>

                    <h4>Step 2: Implantation</h4>
                    <p>The extracted follicles are then carefully implanted into the balding or thinning areas of the scalp, ensuring a natural aesthetic.</p>

                    <h4>Extraction (Follicular Unit Harvesting)</h4>
                    <p>Hair follicles at the back and sides of the scalp are genetically <strong>resistant to androgenic miniaturization</strong> (the process driven by DHT, dihydrotestosterone, that causes male/female pattern baldness). That’s why they’re chosen as the donor source.</p>
                    <p>Human hair naturally grows in small groupings of 1–4 hairs called <strong>follicular units</strong>. Each unit also contains sebaceous (oil) glands, nerves, and connective tissue.</p>
                    <p>Instead of using manual punches, a motorized/micro-surgical punch tool removes follicular units one by one. This reduces trauma to surrounding tissue and increases the survival rate of the follicles. </p>

                    <h4>Implantation (Recipient Site Placement)</h4>
                    <p>For a natural look, the surgeon must place each follicle at the right <strong>angle, depth, and orientation</strong>, mimicking natural hair growth patterns. Once implanted, follicles survive through <strong>diffusion of nutrients</strong> from surrounding tissue until new blood vessels form around them (angiogenesis). Transplanted follicles temporarily enter a <strong>telogen (resting) phase</strong>, causing the implanted hairs to shed within a few weeks. After 3–4 months, they re-enter the <strong>anagen (growth) phase</strong>, producing permanent new hair.</p>
                    <p>Since the follicles retain their <strong>donor resistance to DHT</strong>, they continue growing in the recipient area, making the result long-lasting.</p>
